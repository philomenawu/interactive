    <p>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</p>
    <p>by Eric Carle</p>
    <p>
        In the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf.<br> 
        One Sunday morning the warm sun came up and — POP! — out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar.<br>  
        He started looking for some food.<br>   
        On Monday he ate through one apple.<br> 
        But he was still hungry.<br> 
        On Tuesday he ate through two pears, but he was still hungry.<br>  
        On Wednesday he ate through three plums, but he was still hungry.<br>   
        On Thursday he ate through four strawberries, but he was still hungry.<br>   
        On Friday he ate through five oranges, but he was still hungry.<br> 
        On Saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake, one ice-cream cone, one pickle, one slice of Swiss cheese, one slice of salami, one lollipop, one piece of cherry pie, one sausage, one cupcake, and one slice of watermelon.<br>   
        That night he had a stomachache!<br>   
        The next day was Sunday again.<br>  
        The caterpillar ate through one nice leaf, and after that he felt much better.<br>   
        Now he wasn't hungry anymore — and he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore.<br>   
        He was a big, fat caterpillar.<br>   
        He built a small house, called a cocoon, around himself.<br>   
        He stayed inside for more than two weeks.<br>   
        Then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon, pushed his way out and...He became a beautiful butterfly!
