    <p>Days With Frog and Toad: Alone</p>
    <p>by Arnold Lobel</p>
    <p>
        Toad went to Frog's house. He found a note on the door.<br>
        The note said, “Dear Toad, I am not at home. I went out. I want to be alone.”<br>
        “Alone?” said Toad. “Frog has me for a friend. Why does he want to be alone?”<br>
        Toad looked through the windows. He looked in the garden. He did not see Frog.<br> 
        Toad went to the woods. Frog was not there. He went to the meadow. Frog was not there.<br> 
        Toad went down to the river. There was Frog. He was sitting on an island by himself.<br>
        “Poor Frog,” said Toad. “He must be very sad. I will cheer him up.”<br>
        Toad ran home. He made sandwiches.<br>
        He made a pitcher of iced tea. He put everything in a basket. Toad hurried back to the river.<br>
        “Frog,” he shouted, “it's me. It's your best friend, Toad!” Frog was too far away to hear.<br>
        Toad took off his jacket and waved it like a flag. Frog was too far away to see.<br>
        Toad shouted and waved, but it was no use.<br>
        Frog sat on the island. He did not see or hear Toad.<br>
        A turtle swam by. Toad climbed on the turtle's back.<br>
        “Turtle,” said Toad, “carry me to the island. Frog is there. He wants to be alone.”<br>
        “If Frog wants to be alone,” said the turtle, “why don't you leave him alone?”<br>
        “Maybe you are right,” said Toad. “Maybe Frog does not want to see me.<br> 
        Maybe he does not want me to be his friend anymore.”<br>
        “Yes, maybe,” said the turtle as he swam to the island.<br>
        “Frog!” cried Toad. “I am sorry for all the dumb things I do.<br>
        I am sorry for all the silly things I say. Please be my friend again!” Toad slipped off the turtle.<br>
        With a splash, he fell in the river.<br>
        Frog pulled Toad up onto the island. Toad looked in the basket. The sandwiches were wet.<br>
        The pitcher of iced tea was empty.<br>
        “Our lunch is spoiled,” said Toad. “I made it for you, Frog, so that you would be happy.”<br>
        “But Toad,” said Frog. “I am happy. I am very happy.<br>
        This morning when I woke up I felt good because the sun was shining.<br> 
        I felt good because I was a frog. And I felt good because I have you for a friend. I wanted to be alone.<br>
        I wanted to think about how fine everything is.”<br>
        “Oh,” said Toad. “I guess that is a very good reason for wanting to be alone.”<br>
        “Now,” said Frog, “I will be glad not to be alone. Let's eat lunch.”<br>
        Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon. They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.<br>
        They were two close friends sitting alone together.
