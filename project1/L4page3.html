    <h1>The Kissing Hand</h1>
    <h3><i>by Audrey Penn</i></h3>
    <p>
        <b>Chester Raccoon stood at the edge of the forest and cried.</b><br>
        "I don't want to go to school," he told his mother. "I want to stay home with you."<br><br>
        "I want to play with my friends.<br>
        And play with my toys.<br>
        And read my books.<br>
        And swing on my swing.<br>
        Please may I stay home with you?"<br><br>
        Mrs. Raccoon took Chester by the hand and nuzzled him on the ear.<br>
        "Sometimes we all have to do things we don't want to do," she told him gently.<br>
        "Even if they seem strange and scary at first. But you will love school once you start."<br><br>
        "You'll make new friends.<br>
        And play with new toys.<br>
        Read new books.<br>
        And swing on new swings."<br><br>
        "Besides," she added, "I know a wonderful secret that will make your nights at school seem as warm and cozy as your days at home."<br><br>
        Chester wiped away his tears and looked interested. "A secret? What kind of secret?"<br><br>
        "A very old secret," said Mrs. Raccoon. "I learned it from my mother, and she learned it from hers. It's called the <em>Kissing Hand</em>."<br><br>
        "The Kissing Hand?" asked Chester. "What's that?"<br><br>
        "I'll show you." Mrs. Raccoon took Chester's left hand and spread open his tiny fingers into a fan.<br>
        Leaning forward, she kissed Chester right in the middle of his palm.<br>
        Chester felt his mother's kiss rush from his hand, up his arm, and into his heart. Even his silky, black mask tingled with a special warmth.<br><br>
        Mrs. Raccoon smiled. "Now," she told Chester, "whenever you feel lonely and need a little loving from home, just press your hand to your cheek and think<br><br>
        <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <i>'Mommy loves you. Mommy loves you.'</i></h4><br>
        And that very kiss will jump to your face and fill you with toasty warm thoughts."<br>
        She took Chester's hand and carefully wrapped his fingers around the kiss.<br>
        "Now, do be careful not to lose it," she teased him.<br>
        "But, don't worry. When you open your hand and wash your food, I promise the kiss will stick."<br><br>
        Chester loved his Kissing Hand. Now he knew his mother's love would go with him wherever he went. Even to school.<br>
        That night, Chester stood in front of his school and looked thoughtful.<br>
        Suddenly, he turned to his mother and grinned.<br><br>
        "Give me your hand," he told her.<br><br>
        Chester took his mother's hand in his own and unfolded her large, familiar fingers into a fan.<br>
        Next, he leaned forward and kissed the center of her hand.<br>
        "Now you have a Kissing Hand, too," he told her.<br>
        And with a gentle<br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <em>"Good-bye"</em> and <em>"I love you,"</em><br><br>
        Chester turned and danced away.<br><br>
        Mrs. Raccoon watched Chester scamper across a tree limb and enter school.<br>
        And as the hoot owl rang in the school year, she pressed her left hand to her cheek and smiled.<br>
        The warmth of Chester's kiss filled her heart with special words.<br><br>
        <h4><i>"Chester loves you," it sang.<br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        "Chester loves you."</i></h4><br><br>
