    <p>There is a place where the sidewalk ends</p>
    <p>And before the street begins,</p>
    <p>And there the grass grows soft and white,</p>
    <p>And there the sun burns crimson bright,</p>
    <p>And there the moon-bird rests from his flight</p>
    <p>To cool in the peppermint wind.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black</p>
    <p>And the dark street winds and bends.</p>
    <p>Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow</p>
    <p>We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,</p>
    <p>And watch where the chalk-white arrows go</p>
    <p>To the place where the sidewalk ends.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,</p>
    <p>And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,</p>
    <p>For the children, they mark, and the children, they know</p>
    <p>The place where the sidewalk ends.</p>
