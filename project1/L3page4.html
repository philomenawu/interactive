    <p>There is a place where the sidewalk ends<br>
    And before the street begins,<br>
    And there the grass grows soft and white,<br>
    And there the sun burns crimson bright,<br>
    And there the moon-bird rests from his flight<br>
    To cool in the peppermint wind.<br>
    <br><br>
    Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black<br>
    And the dark street winds and bends.<br>
    Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow<br>
    We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
    And watch where the chalk-white arrows go<br>
    To the place where the sidewalk ends.<br>
    <br><br>
    Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
    And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,<br>
    For the children, they mark, and the children, they know<br>
    The place where the sidewalk ends.<br>
